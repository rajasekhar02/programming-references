## Steps should follow while solving Data structures and Algorithm problem

* First Solve the question on the paper then start coding
* Try extreme values as inputs to check for correctness. What happens if you put in 0? 1? A negative number? Infinity? Do you end up with division by zero or some other crazy result?
